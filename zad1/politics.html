					<p class="snippet">On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will take up President Donald Trump's already-doomed proposal to re-open the government by offering temporary protections for DACA recipients in exchange for money to build his border wall. Then, on Wednesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi will hold a vote in the House on a continuing resolution that would re-open the government through February 28. It will pass the House and be ignored by the Senate.
					<br>So, stalemate. And, if that all happens, we will be 33 days into the longest government shutdown in American history with absolutely zero prospects for a deal....</p>

					<p class="snippet">At least 12 members of the Afghan military were killed and another 28 injured when the Taliban carried out a suicide attack on a military base in the central province of Maidan Wardak, authorities said.
					<br>The terror group attempted to detonate two car bombs near the base, one of which went off, according to a statement from the provincial media office. Three militants were killed in the incident.

					<br>In another, the balaclava-clad elite soldier - whose face we masked - helps to carry an injured victim. He was also seen clasping a woman’s hand as he led her to safety.

					<p class="snippet">A tentative agreement was reached Tuesday in the first teachers strike in Los Angeles in 30 years, allowing educators to start returning to the classroom on Wednesday.
					<br>More than 30,000 teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District went on strike Jan. 14 in a school system that serves about 640,000 students.

					<p class="snippet">British opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn moved a step closer to paving the way for another referendum on European Union membership by trying to use parliament to grab control of Brexit from Prime Minister Theresa May.
					<br>With the clock ticking down to March 29, the date set in law for Brexit, the United Kingdom is in the deepest political crisis in half a century as it grapples with how, or even whether, to exit the European project it joined in 1973.
					<br>Since May’s divorce deal with the EU was rejected by 432-202 lawmakers last week, the biggest defeat in modern British history...</p>

					<p class="snippet">Whatever your take on the Trump administration's economic agenda, we should all agree on one thing: contrary to President Trump's assertion, trade wars are neither good nor easy to win.

					<br>It culminated in the U.S-China trade conflict that has rattled global markets...</p>
